# DPA (Daily Positive Actions)
DPA is a personal growth app designed to help you build consistency through small, meaningful habits.
Each day, the app presents you with a fresh list of 20 positive tasks to choose from. You simply choose the actions you want to commit to for the day, and return at night (8pm) to check them off.

# Features
## Zero Decision Fatigue
Don't waste energy deciding what to do. An LLM curates the list, you just commit.
##  Web3 integration
Optional wallet connection to store your streaks permanently on-chain.

## Overall
Whether you're working on your health, mindset, productivity, or general well being, DPA makes it easy to stay intentional and accountable; one day at a time.
